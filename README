*****	         EMOL - Easy Map OverLays           ******
********************************************************
a project by Karsten Hinz <k.hinz@tu-bs.de> 
started in 2011

The aim of this Project is go generate or better combine
well known tools to a toolbox for own browser Maps.

In my Opinon it costs too mutch time to set up databases
and write scripts to access them. Therefor this is my
solution:

Featurs:
- install scripts to install it on a free hoster (to be completed)
- Makefile to automaticly download raw data, filter and import
	them into the database
- feature rich example map to start with lots of possibilties
- layer-objects - easy to copy and modify
- a free accessable API wich use my database (works with JSONP)

- a API description can be found in ./server_side/api/apidoc.html
- I hope you can follow my comments in the source files
